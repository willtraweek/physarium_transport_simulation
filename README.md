# Physarium Transport Simulation

Inspired by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A) and [Sage Jenson's](https://sagejenson.com/physarum) work with Physarium Polycephalum and digital biology simulations.

This program is designed to simulate the way that slime molds will grow into efficient transport structures.  Physarium
Polycephalum has been used to attempt a physical-world solution to the travelling salesman problem.  The goal here is to
simulate that and show the interesting transport structures that it can create.
